# React Three Fiber Compatibility Fix

## Issue
React Three Fiber 8.x was incompatible with Next.js 15 and React 19, causing the error:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ReactCurrentOwner')
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Upgraded Dependencies
```bash
npm install react@rc react-dom@rc @react-three/fiber@beta @react-three/drei@latest three@latest --legacy-peer-deps
```

**Final Versions:**
- `react`: ^19.0.0-rc.1
- `react-dom`: ^19.0.0-rc.1
- `@react-three/fiber`: ^9.0.0-beta.1
- `@react-three/drei`: ^10.7.6
- `three`: ^0.180.0

### 2. Fixed TypeScript Errors
Added TypeScript ignore comments in `ModelViewer.tsx` to handle beta version type definitions:

```typescript
// @ts-ignore - React Three Fiber beta types
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber';
// @ts-ignore
import { OrbitControls, PerspectiveCamera, useGLTF, Center, Html } from '@react-three/drei';
```

### 3. Extended JSX Types
Added global JSX type declarations for Three.js elements:

```typescript
declare global {
  namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements {
      primitive: any;
      ambientLight: any;
      directionalLight: any;
      pointLight: any;
      gridHelper: any;
    }
  }
}
```

## Current Status
✅ **FIXED** - Development server running successfully at http://localhost:3000
✅ Model viewer compiling without errors
✅ 3D models loading and displaying correctly

## Note
The `@ts-ignore` comments are temporary workarounds for the beta version. Once React Three Fiber 9 is officially released with proper TypeScript definitions, these can be removed.

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to any model page: `http://localhost:3000/model/[id]`
3. Verify 3D model loads in the Canvas viewer
4. Check browser console for React reconciler errors (should be none)
