   - Verify 3D viewer loads
   - Test OrbitControls (rotate, zoom, pan)

3. **Test Edit/Delete**
   - Edit model from dashboard
   - Delete model from dashboard
   - Verify database updates

4. **Production Preparation**
   - Add file deletion when model deleted
   - Add file validation and limits
   - Update environment variables
   - Deploy to Vercel/hosting service

## Server Status
